Welcome to MANTiS - the morphologically adaptive neonate tissue segmentation
  toolbox for SPM.

MANTiS is for tissue classification of neonates from T2 weighted MR
images. It is implemented as a toolbox for the <a
href=http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/> Statistical Parametric Mapping</a>
package in Matlab. It uses a mix of matlab and ITK components and thus
needs to be compiled for your platform.

Follow the links above for instructions.
