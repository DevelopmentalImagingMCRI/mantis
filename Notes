Note for future development.
===========================

We've tried to minimize the hard coding of template details, but
it still shows up periodically. The issue is that the batch system can't
dynamically query the number of image channels, so as soon as a template
is passed between stages as single image, rather than as a set of channels,
we lose information about how many channels there are.

The 9 channels are currently hard coded into the vout function of 
cg_mantis_make_tpm.

An example of how to get around it is in the phase2 segmentation - it 
takes an input which only serves to provide a channel count - it is
a bit ugly.

The alternative is to use the global setting in the mantis options....
